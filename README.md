**_Evocation_** is a project developed with Laravel. 

Evocation is a web application which identifies the attendance of the students in school by a magnet contactless card.
Their checkin is automatically processed by the system and it verifies that they are in the school and in class. The data
from the identification are applied real time in the site's school register, which makes the teachers' work easier and notifies 
the students' parents. Evocation has many different account levels and that allows inside in-depth (detailed) information about
all attendances and absences of students.

Evocation participated in the national olympiad of information technologies (NOIT 2019, Bulgaria).
